# Fullstack Project

## Overview
This project is a fullstack web application where I am learning and exploring backend development using Node.js and Express.js, alongside my frontend experience in React with Vite.

## Features
- Frontend built with React and Vite
- Backend built with Node.js and Express.js
- RESTful API integration
- Basic CRUD operations
- Database integration (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
- Authentication (JWT)
- Backend validation

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React**: For building the UI components.
- **Vite**: For faster builds and development.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: For running the backend server.
- **Express.js**: For setting up the API routes and middleware.
- **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL**: For storing data.
- **JWT**: For user authentication.

## Learning Goals
- Understanding how the backend works with Node.js and Express.
- Learning to set up API routes and handle requests.
- Managing databases and making connections to the backend.
- Implementing user authentication and authorization.
- Building a secure backend with proper validation and error handling.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or above)
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL installed
- Vite CLI for React

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>

2. Install backend dependencies:
    cd backend
    npm install

3. Start the backend server:
    npm run dev


This version includes React and Vite as your frontend technologies. Let me know if you need more adjustments!
